# TextMiningofConsumerProductReview
Text Mining of Consumer Product Review
Here unstructured data is taken into context which will be filtered to remove noisy data and pre-processed to evaluate sentiment of the 
product reviews. The proposed work will help future buyers to make better decisions on the basis of analysis of feedback received by a 
particular product. Comparison of several machine learning algorithms on the task of Text mining of product. Feed-Forward Neural Networks, 
Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory algorithms are applied.
